# Prioritization_Matrix

This is a small project I created to help with prioritizing various tasks one may have.
I was inspired to create this by @jashiicorrin (on Instagram), where she had a journal page template that used this same logic to determine which tasks were more important than others. A matrix is used to compare every task against the others, each comparison made determines which task is more important than the other. These steps ultimately lead to a list of the most to least important tasks.
I appreciated the simplistic and systematic logic used, as I personally will benefit from using my code to make prioritizing many tasks easier.

As of right now, my code initially creates a text file, and then writes/appends to it when the code is ran more than once.
In the future, I hope to redesign the way I implement 'saving' the output of my code.

*Note: To run this code file, the package NumPy must be installed.
